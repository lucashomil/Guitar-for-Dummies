# Classifying Guitar Note Sounds using Deep Learning

A guitar application that can help guitar beginners to learn easily via a web app built on Flask.

For this project, I will use a dataset made by me. The dataset contains 720 sound files of guitar notes and CSV file has file names and labels.

I used my acoustic guitar to build this dataset. The notes were played by guitar picks on open strings, and on the 1st-3th frets on every string. The notes were recorded and labeled by me using an IOS app called Hokusai 2. That's why the quality of the notes are okay. Also, the guitar was always in standard tuning. I used the GuitarTuner app to tune the Guitar.

Convolutional neural network (CNN) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) algorithms trained on guitar-for-dummies dataset with some 720 observations, that predicts what note is played and where it is located on the fretboard.
